    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to address the challenge faced by Wells of Life, an NGO operating in Tanzania, in effectively identifying water wells in need of repair. With over 57 million people struggling to access clean water, many existing water points require maintenance or have failed entirely. The problem statement revolves around the inefficiency in prioritizing maintenance efforts due to limited resources and the lack of a systematic approach to assess the condition of water wells. To tackle this issue, the project aims to develop a classifier that utilizes various data points such as pump type, installation date, and other relevant variables to predict the condition of water wells accurately. By doing so, Wells of Life can optimize their resource allocation, prioritize critical repairs, and intervene proactively to prevent disruptions in water supply, ultimately improving access to clean water for communities in Tanzania. \n",

    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop insights into trends and patterns distinguishing between non-functional and functional wells.\n",
    "* Utilize straightforward analysis to pinpoint non-functioning wells and forecast well functionality based on available variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can historical data accurately predict water well conditions?\n",
    "* What challenges exist in predicting well conditions, and how can they be addressed?\n",
    "* How does the classifier's performance compare to existing methods?\n",
    "* hat insights can the classifier provide for decision-making and resource allocation?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To ensure that newly constructed wells are of good quality water for the communities.\n",
    "* To  correctly identify functionality of a well and determine its viability.\n",
    "* Generating a model that will be able to correctly predict the quality status of the wells in Tanzania with an accuracy of 80%."

    "\n",
    "By analyzing various factors such as pump type, installation date, and management practices, the dataset allows for the classification of pumps into three categories: functional, in need of repair, or non-functional. This intermediate-level practice competition aims to leverage the dataset to enhance maintenance operations and ensure access to clean water for Tanzanian communities. A thorough understanding of the dataset's source, properties, and suitability for addressing the real-world problem is essential for developing accurate predictive models. Overall, the dataset presents an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to improve water infrastructure management and enhance water accessibility in Tanzania.\n"
